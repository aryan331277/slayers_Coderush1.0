Following is the data that we  have collected along with the use<br>
<br>

Aditya-L1 Payloads (ISRO)<br>
Payload	File Type	Notes / Key Features<br>
SUIT	.fits	UV imaging → flare / CME precursor detection<br>
ASPEX Steps	.cdf	Particle flux spectra, solar wind particles<br>
ASPEX Swiss	.cdf	Particle measurements, different energy bands<br>
PAPA	.cdf	Plasma: density, velocity, temperature → dynamic pressure<br>
MAG	.cdf	Magnetic field: Bx, By, Bz, magnitude, sudden changes<br>
Solexs	.fits	X-ray imaging → high-energy solar events<br>


Multi Modal is done
O/p which is detection classification and time series analysis
